#### Repository of the Data Validation tool

Having high quality data has an enormous potential in improving the data flows within the processes of your company, and is vital in analyzing your data 
and interpret the results. Therefore, the data quality needs to be checked. For instance, the data may contain errors, missing values, wrongfully labeled 
data or low sampling rates from sensors. The data validation tool guides you through the important steps when assessing the quality of the data, and gives 
you tips and tricks how and what to adjust for improving the overall quality of your data. In addition, the Data Validation tool functions as a stepping 
stone towards analyzing your data using the Data Analytics tool.


This repository can be used to learn about validating your data as described in the Di-Plast project. To use the tool, please carefully read the descriptions written in the .docx file.

The tool can be accessed using the following link: https://diplastdatavalidation.streamlit.app.

The Data Validation tool is funded by the Interreg North-West Europe program (Interreg NWE), project Di-Plast - Digital Circular Economy for the Plastics Industry (NWE729, https://www.nweurope.eu/projects/project-search/di-plast-digital-circular-economy-for-the-plastics-industry/).
